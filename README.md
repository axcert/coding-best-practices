- GitHub: Workflow (e.g., GitHub Flow), issue tracking, and repository management

## Coding Standards

### PHP (Laravel)

- PSR standards (PSR-1, PSR-2, PSR-4)
- Laravel best practices (naming conventions, MVC structure, database migrations)

### JavaScript (React, Next.js)

- ECMAScript 6+ standards
- React component structure and naming conventions
- Next.js file-based routing and server-side rendering considerations

- Flux/Redux for React state management
- BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for Flutter

## Code Review Process

- Peer review guidelines (what to look for in a review, how to give constructive feedback)
- Automated code review tools integration (e.g., SonarQube, Codacy)

## Testing

- Unit testing frameworks and best practices (PHPUnit for PHP, Jest for JavaScript, Dart's built-in testing for Flutter)
- Integration and end-to-end testing (Laravel Dusk, Cypress for React and Next.js, Flutter integration testing)

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- CI/CD pipeline examples (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)
- Deployment strategies for web and mobile applications

## Documentation

- Inline code documentation standards
- README.md and wikis for project overviews and setup guides
